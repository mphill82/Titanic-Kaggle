### Predicting Titanic Passenger Survival

**Description:** Here I use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.  I train a logistic regression model on the passengersâ€™ class, sex, age, and whether they are a child.  Feature extraction was required to find many missing ages based on the title in their names.  My model scored a .77751 on Kaggle.
<br><br>
**Concepts Demonstrated:** data visualization, feature extraction with regular expressions, cross validation, as well as k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest classifiers.
